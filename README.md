# Content-Management-System-
A platform for public safety agencies and organizations to easily and intuitively connect with their communities.

THE PROBLEM:

The disconnect between law enforcement/public saftey organizations and their communities is a consistently trending topic in todays social climate. Web portals are a great way for organizations to connect and provide resources for their communities.  
However, law enforcement and public safety organizations have strict budgetary constraints and typically do not have staffed team memebers with the skillsets to navigate most content management systems. 

Other CMS platforms cannot perform necessary features like submitting an anonymous tip, filing an online police report and  requesting additional patrol AND integrate into the operative processes with the agency


THE SOLUTION:  

This platform was built for law enforcement agencies to provide information and resources to their community using their language, an intutive interface, and integrating with their operational platforms.
